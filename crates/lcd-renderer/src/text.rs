//! The panel's text, set in a real typeface.
//!
//! The panel is a framebuffer and nothing else: it holds no font, accepts no
//! string, and shows exactly the pixels it is given. Every glyph on the glass
//! is therefore rasterized here, which means the choice of face is entirely
//! ours and there is no reason for it to be anything but a proper one.
//!
//! The face is a subset of Noto Sans ExtraBold, 98 glyphs of the 3000 the family
//! carries, cut with `pyftsubset` to the printable ASCII range plus the degree
//! sign and the middle dot. Ten kilobytes, embedded rather than looked up
//! through fontconfig: the daemon and the client have to rasterize the same
//! pixels from the same description, and a face resolved from the system would
//! make that depend on what happens to be installed.
//!
//! ExtraBold because the panel is read at a glance from across a desk, through
//! a glass and at whatever brightness the operator chose: a heavy numeral holds
//! its shape there where a semibold one thins out, and the caption under it is
//! set small enough that the weight never crowds it.
//!
//! Sizes here are cap heights, not em sizes. A layout on a 240 pixel panel is
//! reasoned about in terms of how tall the digits look, and the em box is
//! neither visible nor constant across faces.
