//! The picture the preview draws, compiled once rather than per repaint.
//!
//! Both kinds of picture live here. Image mode plays the frames of a decoded
//! file; every other mode shows one frame rendered from the preset and the
//! readings. They used to be built in different places and cached to different
//! degrees: the film was keyed by what it depends on, and the rendered frame
//! was produced inside the element tree on every single repaint, which is once
//! per pointer move of any drag anywhere on the screen.
//!
//! One [`Identity`] now keys both, so a repaint draws bytes that already exist
//! and a picture is built exactly when something it depends on moved.
