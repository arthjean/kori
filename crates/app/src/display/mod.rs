//! The pending state of the LCD screen.

//! Mirrors [`crate::lighting`]: everything here is an edit, and this structure
//! holds it. Choosing a color or picking a metric changes nothing else. What
//! turns it into a frame is the row going quiet, not a button, and the daemon
//! still accepts or refuses the preset that results.
//!
//! Colors are held as the six digits the operator typed rather than as parsed
//! values. That is what lets an incomplete entry stay on screen with its own
//! error while the preview keeps showing the last picture that was valid, which
//! is what an editor owes the operator instead of a field that silently
//! reverts.
//!
//! What the preview actually draws is compiled next door, in the `film`
//! module, and held rather than rebuilt per repaint.
