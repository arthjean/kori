//! Every control shares one interaction model: it is either enabled, disabled
//! with a reason, or in error. Disabled is never decorative here. It is how the
//! product refuses to expose a write the hardware has not proven it supports,
//! so each primitive carries the reason rather than silently graying out.
//!
//! Split by what a primitive is rather than by what it is made of: the pill,
