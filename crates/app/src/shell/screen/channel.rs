//! One cooling channel as a line, with its controls one activation away.
//!
//! Collapsed, the line is readback only: what the channel is doing, from which
//! temperature source, in what mode. Opening it reveals the controls for that
//! channel alone, so the curve editor never has to ask which channel it is
//! editing.
//!
//! Every reading on the line comes from the hardware rather than from the
//! pending edit. A row that still names the previous program after a mode
//! change is a write that has not landed, and that is exactly what this line
//! has to be able to say.
//!
//! The row itself is built from the pieces in [`super::row`], which the
//! Lighting screen assembles too. This module wrote its own copy of them until
//! three of its comments were identical, character for character, to the ones
//! next door.
