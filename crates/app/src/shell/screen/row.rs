//! One openable row, and what it opens.

//! Every list of rows in this interface is the same object with different
//! contents: the lighting channels, the panel, and the two cooling channels.
//! The frame is stated once here.
//!
//! It has been restated before. The channels and the panel each wrote their own
//! scaffold, down to the same four comments word for word, until
//! `Shell::device_row` was written to say it once; the Cooling screen then
//! grew a third copy, with three of those comments identical character for
//! character. So the pieces below are the parts, not the whole: the container a
//! row carries while open, the band that lights up under the pointer, and the
//! region that opens it. A screen assembles them with the controls it has.
