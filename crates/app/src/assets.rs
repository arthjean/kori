//! The icons the interface draws, compiled into the binary.
//!
//! GPUI reaches an SVG through one interface only, [`gpui::AssetSource`], and
//! the path it resolves is a plain string looked up while painting. A wrong
//! path is therefore a silently missing icon, not a compile error: `Svg::paint`
//! logs the miss and draws nothing. Two things push that failure back to build
//! time. The bytes are embedded with `include_bytes!`, so a moved file stops the
//! build, and the only way to name an icon is [`Icon`], so a caller cannot spell
//! a path at all.
//!
//! Embedding also keeps the binary self-contained, which the packaged install
//! needs: the upstream GPUI example reads assets from `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR` at
//! runtime, which is a developer's checkout and not a deployed program.
