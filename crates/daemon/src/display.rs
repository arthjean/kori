//! The only caller that sends a frame to the Kraken's panel.
//!
//! Mirrors [`crate::lighting`]: one owner, one record of what was committed,
//! one place a frame leaves the process. Two rules live here rather than at the
//! screen, because the screen is not a trusted input.
//!
//! **A frame identical to the committed one is not sent.** The comparison is on
//! the rendered picture, not on the preset, so a solid field or a static image
//! costs one transfer however often Apply is activated, and an infographic
//! whose readings did not move costs none. Whether a fraction of a degree
//! survives into a different picture depends on where the antialiased end of
//! the gauge happens to fall, so nothing here promises it either way. The
//! stream produces one frame a second regardless.
//!
//! **The brightness is not part of that comparison.** It is a panel setting
//! carried by its own report, so it is written before the picture is compared
//! and a deduplicated frame never swallows it. Sending it afterwards was a
//! defect: a preset whose only edit was the brightness renders the same pixels,
//! so the glass stayed at the old level until some reading happened to move the
//! picture, and the client said "nothing was sent" the whole time.
//!
//! **At most one frame is ever outstanding.** The transfer is synchronous, so
//! "outstanding" here means the sample that arrived while the previous frame
//! was still being written. Such a sample replaces the pending one rather than
//! queueing behind it: a panel showing a temperature from four seconds ago
//! because three frames are waiting is worse than a panel that skipped them.
//!
//! **A refusal the panel imposes is a [`HardwareState`], never an error.** This
//! is the one of the three executors that still returns a `Result`, and what its
//! error channel carries is the single thing the other two cannot meet: a preset
//! that has no bytes to send, because the picture it names could not be
//! rendered. Nothing about the panel's own behavior travels that way, so a
//! caller reads "what the hardware did" in one place for all three paths.
//!
//! **An animation is decoded once and then only copied.** A GIF the operator
//! picks is compiled to a table of finished framebuffers when it is applied, so
//! what the tick loop does per frame is a copy and a transfer. It plays on its
//! own clock, taken from the file rather than from the telemetry cadence, and
//! the same rule about late ticks applies to it: the cursor walks the wall
//! clock, so a tick that ran late skips frames instead of playing the animation
//! in slow motion.
