//! What the Kraken's panel is asked to show, as a typed description.
//!
//! A [`DisplayPreset`] is a description, not pixels. It carries no resolution,
//! no pixel format and no protocol byte, so the same value can be rendered into
//! the GPUI preview and into the framebuffer the daemon sends, so the editor
//! previews the exact bytes the panel receives. The rendering itself lives in
//! `kori-lcd-renderer`, and both processes call it.
//!
//! Nothing here reads a file or touches a device. A preset naming a static
//! image carries its path and nothing more: the file is opened by the renderer,
//! at the moment a frame is produced, so an unreadable file is a typed render
//! failure rather than a preset that silently means something else.
